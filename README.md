# Predicting Catalog Demand

The project, is about analyzing a business problem in the mail-order catalog business. The task is with predicting how much money your company can expect to earn from sending out a catalog to new customers. This task will involve building the model and applying the results in order to provide a recommendation to management. The company manufactures and sells high-end home goods. Last year the company sent out its first print catalog, and is preparing to send out this year's catalog in the coming months. The company has 250 new customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog to. Your manager has been asked to determine how much profit the company can expect from sending a catalog to these customers. Task is to predict the expected profit from these 250 new customers. Management does not want to send the catalog out to these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds $10,000.
